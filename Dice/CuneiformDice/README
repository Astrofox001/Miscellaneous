Initially made as a joke, this dice relies on the fact that the Babylonians worked with a base 60 system.
Naturally, this lead me to produce a d60 where all the digits range from 0-59.
I have not produced a version for counting, and the one featured in this directory is meant to be rolled.
I've tried to make it so that opposite faces sum to 59.
I made the cuneiform font too, and it took me a few days to get through the process of making the die.

For the case you want to do anything with these:
Reproducible: TRUE
Profitable: TRUE
You're also allowed to use the cuneiform digits I made for this project.
