I've dipped my toes into making dice as a means of lowering the amount of waste produced by mixed epoxy when building hobby rockets.
I even modelled some dice and come up with a few "color recipes" for the sake of reproducibility (or if I found a certain outcome to be of particular interest).
You are free to download and distribute my dice so long as appropriate credit is given (if reuploaded for no cost, link to this repository or my github profile).
You are even able to sell dice produced from molds of (most of) my dice so long as the afforementioned credit is given, and if a donations link goes up, please don't be shy to tip.
However, that last point does come with one particular responsibility. Please take the time to look at the README files.
I will clearly and explicity state whether or not the dice in that directory can be reproduced and/or sold within the READMEs.
While the restricted items will be privated if possible, please still take the time to look at the README.
