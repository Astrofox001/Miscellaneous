I've dipped my toes into the dicemaking hobby as a means to combat waste from epoxy mixed during the build process of hobby rockets.
I've also modelled some dice, but not much has come of it. Feel free to download, print, and even make molds of the dice.
I won't even be upset if you decide to sell some dice you produce from molds of the models or "coloring recipes" I put up here (UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED, SO ALWAYS CHECK READMEs).
All I ask is that you either credit me (link to this github page) or tip me a little once a donation link goes up (if that ever happens).
